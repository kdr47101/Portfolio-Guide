# Data Analytics & SQL

| Project Link | Area | Tools | Project Description |
|--------------|------|-------|---------------------|
| [Supply Chain Optimization](#) [Dashboard](#) | Data analysis, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, supply chain analytics | Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau | An end-to-end analysis of logistics data to optimize shipment efficiency and improve supply-chain visibility. Work includes cleaning and exploring the dataset, plus a Tableau dashboard highlighting top routes, delay drivers, supplier performance trends, and peak shipment periods |

# Data Engineering & Pipelines

| Project Link | Project Description | Dashboard Link |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| üöï [Uber Taxi](#) | Python, GCP (Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery), Mage, Looker Studio | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processing NYC Trip Record data. The pipeline encompassed extracting raw data, performing data transformation using Python, applying fact and dimensional data modelling techniques, orchestrating the pipeline on Mage, and ultimately creating a dashboard using Looker Studio. |
| üê∂ [Dog Adoption](#) | Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
