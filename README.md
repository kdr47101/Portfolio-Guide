# Data Engineering

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description |
|--------------|-------|----------------------|
| [AML ML Competition Submission](https://github.com/kdr47101/IMI-Big-Data-and-AI-comp-submission) | Python (pandas, scikit-learn, logging), Jupyter Notebooks, Docker, Bash | End-to-end AML transaction analytics pipeline: cleans multi-source bank data, runs IsolationForest anomaly detection, logs results, and exports per-channel anomalies and visualizations for downstream review. |
| üê∂ [Dog Adoption](#) | Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |

# SQL

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------|
| üöï [Uber Taxi](#) | Python, GCP (Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery), Mage, Looker Studio | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processing NYC Trip Record data. The pipeline encompassed extracting raw data, performing data transformation using Python, applying fact and dimensional data modelling techniques, orchestrating the pipeline on Mage, and ultimately creating a dashboard using Looker Studio. |
| üê∂ [Dog Adoption](#) | Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
